# English Markov Chain Word Generator
Iterate through a dictionary and tally up the transitions
between one letter and the next. There's special characters
`^` to mark where words start, and `$` to mark where words
end.

Generate new words by choosing the starting symbol `^` and

letters that appear after that letter, and repeat that over
and over again until one letter leads to the final word-end
symbol, `$`.
